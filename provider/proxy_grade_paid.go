// Paid/file-list proxy grading (design note 2026-08-09).
//
// The URL-source machinery grades every address it admits (stage-1 table
// probe, A-F tiers), but paid/file-list proxies — which come from
// --proxy_file or the internal config and bypass the URL admission gate by
// construction (isURLSourced == false) — were never graded at all. This
// sweep grades EVERY non-URL proxy the box serves with the SAME stage-1
// table probe and the same proxyTableProbeConfig, so the operator sees the
// quality distribution of what the paid lists actually deliver, and the
// grade is available for resource prioritization (roadmap #2) and
// dashboard surfacing (roadmap #3).
//
// SAFETY: this is READ-ONLY with respect to the proxy lifecycle. Grades
// live in proxy.state ProxyEntry (Score/Graded/Failed/LastGraded) and are
// never consulted by admission, eviction, give-up, or cleanup — the "never
// reject" property is structural: paid/file proxies already bypass the
// stage-1 gate, and the sweep only ever writes grade fields. A graded F
// keeps serving exactly as it did before it was graded.
//
// Cadence: one pass every proxyReaperInterval tick, re-probing only
// entries whose LastGraded is older than the reaper stale threshold
// (1-3h, pressure-scaled) — the same window the URL reaper uses, so paid
// grading rides the existing stale sweep cadence. Kill switch:
// proxy_probe.json enabled=false disables the table probe here too
// (a full skip, mirroring the fetch-side invariant).

// gradeTarget is one paid/file proxy scheduled for this grading pass: its
// address, credentials (when resolvable), and the LastGraded snapshot it was
// collected under (so the apply phase can detect a concurrent refresh). Shared
// between the collector, the per-tick budget sorter, and the probe fan-out.
