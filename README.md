A high-performance, high-visibility fork of the **UrNetwork Connect** provider, based on the stable **v3.23** engine. Tuned for professional providers managing large proxy lists, high throughput, and production-grade operations.

## 🆚 What this fork changes vs upstream

| | Upstream | This fork |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Control-plane dial visibility | Debug level 2 (silent) | INFO — one line per successful backend dial (`[net][s]select`, control-plane not relay traffic) |
| Initial contract size | 16 KiB | Min 256 KiB (lowmem), 2 MiB (performance), tunable per profile |
| Proxy startup | All at once | Jittered stagger with live `[pace]` warmup, plus a shared adaptive rate limiter that bounds aggregate auth load on the API |
| Proxy changes | Restart required | Hot-reload via trigger file, zero downtime, with full added-proxy listing |
| Proxy source | Static file only | File and/or live URL feed, with scoped auto-cleanup |
| Error noise | Auth/contract errors spam logs | Rate-limited with suppressed counts |
| Performance profiles | None | Auto / Turbo V4 / Turbo V8 / Eco / Lowmem |
| Crash diagnostics | Journal-only, logs lost on restart | Disk-based critical event log + preserved RAM logs, panic hooks |
| Custom API/connect backend | One-off `--api_url`/`--connect_url` flags only, re-passed on every invocation | `choose_network` persists the URLs to disk; flags still override per-call |

> [!WARNING]
> **Experimental commands:** `provider claim`, `provider bind-head`, `provider unbind-head`, and
> `provider wallet set` are experimental, the mechanism may change, and they are not recommended
> for production use yet. Ported but not exercised against mainnet.

| 🐋 Docker | `docker pull ghcr.io/full-bars/meso-miner:latest` | `docker rm -f <container> && docker rmi ghcr.io/full-bars/meso-miner:latest` |
| 🐋 Docker (manage) | [`curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-bars/meso-miner/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-urnet-docker.sh \| sh`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-bars/meso-miner/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-urnet-docker.sh) | `rm /usr/local/bin/urnet-docker` (root) or `rm ~/.local/bin/urnet-docker` (non-root) |

After installation, authenticate and start providing:

```bash
# Linux / macOS: one Go binary on every platform
urnetwork auth
urnet-tools proxy add ~/proxies.txt
urnet-tools proxy refresh
urnet-tools auto on
```
On Windows, run the same commands in PowerShell but use a Windows path, e.g.
`urnet-tools proxy add "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\proxies.txt"`. Full per-OS
walkthrough, including the `.txt.txt` extension trap: [Adding Proxies](docs/Adding-Proxies.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Since v3.23.0-fix.27.0, `urnet-tools` is a provider-aware Go binary (the legacy POSIX shell + PowerShell variants are retired). It discovers every provider on the box and **refuses to act on an ambiguous target** — on multi-provider machines, pass `--unit` / `--user` / `--network` / `--network-id` / `--state-dir`. See [docs/urnet-tools-go.md](docs/urnet-tools-go.md).
>
> Docker-only deployments: the provider runs in a container, but the management tool (`urnet-docker`) runs **on the docker host, outside the container**. Install it with the one-liner above (use `curl -fSsL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/full-bars/meso-miner/refs/heads/main/scripts/install-urnet-docker.sh | sh -s -- urnet-tools` for the systemd variant). The tool self-updates afterward (`urnet-docker update`).

### 🐋 Docker (Production-Ready)

Recommended for real deployments — includes auto-tuning, in-memory logs, persistent config, and bandwidth monitoring:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=urnetwork-provider \
  --pull=always \
  --restart=unless-stopped \
  --cap-add=NET_ADMIN \
  --cap-add=NET_RAW \
  --sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 \
  -e BUILD=jwt \
  -e URNETWORK_PROFILE=auto \
  -e URNETWORK_RAMLOGS=1 \
  -e ENABLE_VNSTAT=true \
  -e HOST_HOSTNAME=$(hostname) \
  -e PROXY_URL='https://example.com/your-proxy-list.txt' \
  -v urnetwork_config:/root/.urnetwork \
  -v urnetwork_vnstat:/var/lib/vnstat \
  -v /path/to/proxy.txt:/app/proxy.txt \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e URNETWORK_AUTH_CODE='YOUR_AUTH_CODE_HERE' \
  ghcr.io/full-bars/meso-miner:latest
```

**Key env vars:**
- `URNETWORK_PROFILE=auto` — Auto-tunes based on available RAM (balanced, lowmem, etc.)
- `URNETWORK_RAMLOGS=1` — In-memory logging for fast diagnostics (view with `docker exec urnetwork-provider logs`)
- `URNETWORK_AUTH_CODE` — Your JWT token (single-use on first run; saved to volume)
- `PROXY_URL` — Optional live proxy list URL (comma-separated for multiple), additive with the mounted `proxy.txt`. See [Proxy URL Sources](docs/Proxy-URL-Sources.md).
- `UR_API_URL` / `UR_CONNECT_URL` — Point at a custom API + connect backend instead of `bringyour.com`. Must be set together; saved to the `~/.urnetwork` volume so it survives restarts. See [Configuration Reference](docs/Configuration.md).

See [Docker Deployment](docs/Docker-Deployment.md) for Docker Compose, email/password auth, Watchtower, multi-container, and advanced options.

> [!NOTE]
> **Docker shortcuts** — `urnet-tools` commands work via `docker exec` (same as bare-metal):
> - `docker exec -it urfix urnet-tools proxy health`
> - `docker exec -it urfix urnet-tools logs`
> - `docker exec -it urfix urnet-tools status`
> - `docker exec -it urfix urnet-tools session save /root/.urnetwork/backup.urnsession`

## 🔧 Common Operations

| Command | Use this when... |
| :--- | :--- |
| `urnetwork auth` | You need to log in or refresh your identity manually |
| `urnet-tools proxy traffic` | You want to see active clients, bandwidth, and **Max Age** per proxy |
| `urnet-tools proxy health` | You need to see which proxies are `DEAD` vs `DEGRADED` vs `UP` |
| `urnet-tools logs` | You want to stream the current RAMLOGS buffer |
| `urnet-tools optimize` | You just added many proxies and need to tune kernel `ulimits` |
| `urnet-tools proxy summary` | You want a single-pane fleet overview -- sources, health, URL cache status |
| `urnet-tools proxy refresh` | You updated your proxy list and want the node to reload live |
| `urnet-tools hot-restart on/off` | Toggle client JWT reuse across restarts (on by default; `off` sets `URNETWORK_HOT_RESTART=0`) |
| `urnet-tools session save <file>` | Export identity+proxy state as encrypted bundle (cross-machine transfer) |
| `urnet-tools session load <file>` | Import identity+proxy state, then restart |
| `urnet-tools report` | You want to check which URL the provider is currently reporting to |
| `urnetwork choose_network <api_url> <connect_url>` | You run your own API/connect backend and want the provider to default to it |
| `urnetwork choose_network --reset` | You want to clear a saved custom network and revert to the main network |

> [!TIP]
> `~/proxies.txt` and `/home/user/proxies.txt` are both valid path formats.

## 💡 Recommended Defaults

- Use the **Linux installer** for a host-managed systemd service
- Use **Docker** if you prefer containers — both are fully documented
- Leave profile on **`auto`** unless you have a specific reason to override
- Mount `/root/.urnetwork` as a persistent volume in Docker deployments
- Run `urnet-tools optimize` after adding a large proxy list, or when the System Auditor flags kernel limits
